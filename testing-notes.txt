'assert' is really useful, for example - asserting that an elastic constants matrix is positive definite before you run any more code is a really good way of identifying where the errors are!

assert is best for when something should always pass and the user is not expected to see the error.

assert is just an 'if' statement and a 'raise' statement grouped together.

can also turn off assert statements if they cause the code to run slowly and only turn them on if you think there's an error.

things worth checking - e.g., is the list a list of numbers, does the list contain at least one element?

use travis-ci.org for testing code in github repositories (sign in using github).
